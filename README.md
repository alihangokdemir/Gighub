# Gighub
A simple social networking website for live music lovers.

Musicians can sign up and list their upcoming gigs and their followers can see all the upcoming gigs 
on the home page or search for them by artist genre or location.

They can add their favorite gigs to their calendar once a musician updates or cancels one of their upcoming gigs, users who are 
attending that gig will see a notification.
